## How to play
The goal is to move pieces through the field and back. It's not possible to put pieces on red places. You may "eat" pieces of your opponent. They will return to start then.
*Please note that this project's rules are different from the original ones. Instead, they resemble rules of mini-game of Aztec, PlayStation 1 quest.*
